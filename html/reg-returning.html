<h3>Required Annual Registration for Current Students Returning in Fall 2015.</h3>
<p>Dear Parents:</p> 
<p>Instructions on this page are for students
<strong>currently enrolled</strong> in the District.
Please visit the <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.kentfieldschools.org//site/Default.aspx?PageID=79">Registration
for New Students page</a>
for instructions about registering incoming students who are 
<strong>not currently enrolled in District schools.</strong></p> 

<p>Registration pages for students enrolling in Kentfield District
schools in the 2014-2015 (both new students and returning students) have been
revised and are now ready for your review. 

Please log into the PowerSchool Parent Portal and click the
"Registration" icon, then review and confirm all registration pages by
clicking the <strong>Submit</strong> button at the bottom of each page.</p>
 
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Your child cannot
be scheduled into classes for the coming school year until all online
registation information is complete. </p> 

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> If your student will 
<strong>not be returning</strong> 
to the Kentfield School District next fall, you
will only need to complete Page 1 of the registration forms to indicate that a
student will be leaving or graduating, and where your student will be next fall.</p>

<p>Registration forms are filled out based on current data you have previously
provided us. You will only need to review, edit, and Submit the online pages,
using the PowerSchool Parent Portal website.</p> 

<p>If you <strong >do not have internet access</strong> or have other problems 
using the online registration system,
please call the appropriate school office so that we can arrange for you to
come in and fill out the registration forms in person; our office staff will
be happy to assist you when you come in. If you have any technical
difficulties completing the registration process, send an email to <a
href="mailto:webmaster@kentfieldschools.org">webmaster@kentfieldschools.org</a>.</p> 

<h3>Confirmation of Registration for Students Currently in KSD</h3>
<p><strong>For each student, the information on all pages for must be reviewed,
revised as necessary, and submitted by Friday, May 30, 2014</strong>, so that
the school offices have time to obtain accurate enrollment counts and assign
resources for the upcoming year. After completing each page, make sure to
click the <strong>Submit</strong> button at the bottom of each page 
so that any information you
update will be recorded correctly.</p> 

<p>By reviewing and confirming the information on these pages, you
will ensure that the District has the correct residential addresses, phone
numbers, and email addresses, emergency contact information, and medical
information in our database. <strong>The data on these
pages is critical in the case of illness or emergency</strong>; please take the
time to review each page and make changes as necessary.</p> 

<p>If any of your children <strong>will not be returning</strong>
to the District next fall, you still must complete Page 1 so that the school
may drop the student at the end of the current school year; the District is
required to report this information to the State of California, and it is also
used in sending your children's records to a new school.</p> 

<h4>Portal Login Information and Lost Passwords </h4> 
<p>To begin
the registration process log in at the PowerSchool Parent Portal at:</p>

Name</strong> and <strong>Password</strong> for the

<p>If you have a Parent Access Account, but have forgotten your User Name 
or Password, click the <strong>"Have trouble logging in?"</strong> link
on the Parent Portal login page, and follow the prompts. Please note that
