The powerschool-web project hosted at github.com

This is a project to post all of the Kentfield School District's 
PowerSchool customizations, including an online registration system,
health forms, and other custom screens in a publicly available 
repository.  You can access the repository at

http://github.com/pzingg/powerschool-web/

Use github's Source Browser to browse the data / custom / web_root tree
to find custom HTML pages, CSS stylesheets, Javascript files, and "wildcard" text files that override the factory default files installed by PowerSchool.

If you can install the Git version control system on your computer,
you can keep current with changes.  Git is available at http://git.or.cz/

We are currently using PowerSchool Premier, and have several hundred
custom fields to hold registration and contact information.  Future
plans include building ODBC connectors to link PowerSchool data to 
other sites.
