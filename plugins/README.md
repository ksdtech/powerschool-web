# Plugins
The new way to customize PowerSchool is through plugins. This folder
contains unzipped plugin source files either developed in-house or
found on PowerSource.

These must be zipped up to install via System > System Settings >
Plugin Management Configuration in PowerSchool.

### Installation
Install in System > System Settings > Plugin Management Configuration.

Do not unzip the plugin. Install the entire zip file. Be sure to enable the plugin once it's installed.

If you are updating, you can now click on the Plugin name and then use the Update button, and then browse to the new file and click Submit and it will then load the update and then ask you to enable it.

### Instructions
To use this plugin, you need to first go to School > Email Lists Preferences (in the General section) and select what field you use for student emails. You can choose the default PowerSchool field, a Legacy Custom field, or a Database Extension field.
**PZ -  We are using a legacy custom field: Student_Email.**
On that page, you can also, by school, determine which of the three columns to show and which to hide. The table and field drop down should display all current options available.

In PowerTeacher, the page is available from a link on the left menu of each section's backpack area. On the admin side, the page is shown for the current student selection by choosing "Build Email Lists" from the functions menu.

On the page, select individual email addresses by checking the box, or select a whole column by checking the box in the column header. You can unselect individual addresses after select the whole column. Select as many addresses in as many columns as desired.

Once the addresses are selected, scroll to the bottom of the page, choose a specific delimiter (comma or semi-colon, depending on what your email program requires) then click the "Copy" button. Your list is created in the text area and selected so you can just copy, using the keyboard shortcut or the menu item.

Paste that list into a new message in your email program. It is always recommended that parent and student email addresses are added to the BCC section, to maintain privacy.
