<tr><td>Legal guardianship is a court order that says someone who is not the 
child’s parent is in charge of taking care of the child. Legal guardians have 
a lot of the same rights and responsibilities as parents. They can decide where 
the child lives and goes to school, and they can make decisions about the child’s health care.</td></tr>

<tr><td>There are 2 kinds of guardianships in California. Most guardianship cases are in 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-guardianship.htm">probate court</a>. These cases are brought by the person seeking to be appointed guardian or 
by someone else in the family asking the court to appoint a guardian.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Another kind of guardianship arises when the custody of a minor is awarded to a 
non-parent through the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/1206.htm">juvenile dependency court.</a></td></tr>
