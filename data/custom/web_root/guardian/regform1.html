Scheduling a student's day is a complicated process, and it is
very important that you select a music class that is appropriate for
your student.  Students should choose carefully in
making their music selection, as we are creating sections and
staffing them according to student requests. Future changes will not be allowed, so
please be sure to get you child's input before selecting!<br><br>
Music enrollment is a full-year commitment; if you have difficulty in
selecting a music program for your student, please contact the music teacher

either chorus or beginning band. The first year of
instrumental music is spent learning to read music and to become a
"solid" beginner on the flute, clarinet, trumpet, trombone, or
percussion instrument. Students do not have to decide which instrument they want
to play until after classes have started. Information about instrument
choices will be sent home with students the first week of school. Band
students are expected to practice at home. Instruments may be rented or 
purchased through local music stores. Financial assistance is available 
upon request.<br><br>
Students choosing to participate in chorus will learn vocal
techniques through unison and singing in harmony. Song selections will
range from popular to classical. Chorus students also learn to play
the recorder and read music.<br><br>

Concert band students must have had two to three years of previous
playing experience. Emphasis is placed on gaining musical independence
through scale studies, technical exercises and improvisation. Students
work on music from a wide range of musical styles, including jazz and
classical. They perform concerts during the year.<br><br>
Concert choir will meet twice per week. This is an advanced choral
group that works on challenging a cappella material (without
accompaniment). Students wishing to join must be able to match a
pitch, sing in parts, and have the interest and enthusiasm that is
required to develop a high-level choral ensemble. The group will work
on music ranging from jazz to classical. Students with no previous
choral experience, or who are new to the school, must audition with 
the music teacher. The choir will perform concerts during the year.</td></tr>
