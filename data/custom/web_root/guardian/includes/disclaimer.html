<ul>
<li>Teachers will update information at least
twice per trimester, i.e., at mid-term and at the end of the trimester;
information viewed, therefore, may not be current.</li>
<li>Different classes may use different
factoring methods to weight assignment scores; the current percentage
and grade, therefore, may not be equivalent to the average of all
scores reported.</li>
<li>If errors are suspected in any assignment
scores, the student must show the assignment to the teacher for review.</li>
<li>Inappropriate use of the family-access
component of PowerSchool (e.g., accessing records of non-family
members, or inappropriate communication via the system) will result in
loss of access.</li>
